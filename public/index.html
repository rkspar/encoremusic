The group lessons help students understand the fundamentals of music in an interactive and fun way while making the private lessons more focused on technique and performance skills of the chosen instrument. Students may enroll in private lessons only or in a combination of private lessons and group lessons. Encore Music Academy accepts students all year round (children and adults).<br><br>The recommended ages to start private lessons vary according to the instrument of choice. Encore Music Academy also offers Kindermusik group classes designed for students between the ages of 12 months and 4 years of age. These group classes are recommended for the really young children in order to stimulate and develop motor skills from early age.<br><br>Encore Music Academy also prepares students for auditions to performing arts magnet programs as well as college auditions to enter into university for a career in music. An important part of our curriculum is the exposure of our students in recitals, competitions and evaluations. Students from EMA will participate in at least two EMA recitals (one in December at Florida International University and another one in June at the University of Miami Victor E. Clarke Recital Hall).<br><br>According to their level, each student will have the opportunity to participate in local competitions and evaluations that will provide extra performance opportunities. Recital, evaluations outside Encore Music Academy and competitions are subject to extra fees. A list of all registrations fees is available before enrolling students into these events. Encore Music Academy also offers Masterclasses with world renowned musicians so that students can broaden their musical knowledge to even higher levels.</p></center>
